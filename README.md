# SeedMod
Mod for finding changes to the world compared to the seed

# Issues
1. For some reason forge currently does not recognize the jar as a mod. 
 UPDATE: I think I found the reason, I think you have to force load it as a mod and have a IFMLplugin
 this is fine because we need that for rendering anyways.
2. this might be related to issue one, the game now whenever 
I try to launch forge with the mod it throws a java runtime error.
3. WE NEED TO ADD MIXINS FOR RENDING AND STUFF LIKE THAT
