# SeedMod

The Mod is for the version 1.12.2, 
currently 
it is basically just a crappy skid of other mods,
but this will change.

Mod for finding changes to the world compared to the seed.

# Issues
1. SeedOverlay says everyblock is not meant to be there,
I assume this can improved upon by improving SimpleBlockMap.

# TODO
1. Fix SimpleBlockMap
2. Render the SeedOverlay
