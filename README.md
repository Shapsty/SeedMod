# SeedMod

The Mod is for the version 1.12.2, 
currently 
it is basically just a crappy skid of other mods,
but this will change.

Mod for finding changes to the world compared to the seed.

# Issues
1. ShowWorldChanges only loops through the first for loop 175 and doesnt loop through any of the embedded loops

# TODO
1. Improve SimpleBlockMap
2. Fix the SeedOverlay command
Fix the for loop issue mentioned in `Issues`, we should start off just by printing all
of the blocks that dont match into chat before we try and render them.

3. Render the SeedOverlay
