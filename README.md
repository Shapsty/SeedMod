# SeedMod

The Mod is for the version 1.12.2, 
currently 
it is basically just a crappy skid of other mods,
but this will change.

Mod for finding changes to the world compared to the seed.

# Issues
1. ShowWorldChanges only loops through the first for loop 175 and doesnt loop through any of the embedded loops

# TODO
1. Make SimpleBlockMap
2. Actually do the SeedOverlay command
This requires well doing it, we should start off just by printing all
of the blocks that dont match into chat before we try and render them.

3. Render the SeedOverlay
